GameEngine
==========

First attempt on C++ Game Engine for a mobile platform

- This GameEngine will be coded in C++ and with OPENGL ES 2.0.

I'm using the Android NDK at the moment my version is Android NDK, Revision 9d (March 2014)!
This is a project for learning purposes that being said I do care VERY MUCH about the architecture of the engine.

Engine Will feature such things as 

 * KERNEL
 * GAME TIMER
 * RENDERER
 * TASK SYSTEM

			static const unsigned int	PLATFORM_PRIORITY	= 1000;
			static const unsigned int	FILE_PRIORITY		= 2000;
			static const unsigned int	GAME_PRIORITY		= 3000;
			static const unsigned int	AUDIO_PRIORITY		= 4000;
			static const unsigned int	RENDER_PRIORITY		= 5000;
